#### Community Engagement
A Discord community is *the next generation of social engagement*.
You may not have heard of it yet, but [Discord](https://discordapp.com/) is a very popular voice and text chat platform. 
We have decided to use the platform Discord to properly engage with the chatty people that are using the Lithe network.
The Lithe Project also uses Twitter as another form of contact with its handle being [@TheLitheProject](https://twitter.com/thelitheproject).
A firm community is what drives popularity and strengthens the project.
Members of the community will always drive for more people to join, more development and general attraction of the project.
Usually the early adapters of a project end up becoming loyal to that project, they’re good souls. 
Community members could help raise funds for development, help support the project and also the people using it and help establish connections to the right paths.
